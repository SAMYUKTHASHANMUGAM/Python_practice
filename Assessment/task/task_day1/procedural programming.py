#Procedural Programming Paradigm
#Code is executed step-by-step
#creating functions for addition
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

#creating main function 
def main():
    a = 10
    b = 20
    sum = add(a,b)
    print("The output for procedural programming \n The sum of two digits will be , ",sum)

main()


#output
#main()
    #add()
